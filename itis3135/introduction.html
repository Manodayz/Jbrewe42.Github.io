            <li><strong>Personal Background:</strong> I'm from a place near Asheville. I love teaching and working with kids, and always strive to learn more and more.</li>
            <li><strong>Professional Background:</strong>I've worked with multiple companies over the years, but none of them were related to web development.</li>
            <li><strong>Academic Background:</strong>  I took many college courses in High School, and I originally went to a different college before I wound up at UNCC. I don't have a degree yet.</li>

                    <li><strong>MUSC 1502 Global Arts/Humanities:</strong> Music in Global Communities - I like music a lot, and a class that mostly consists of learning about the origins of different types of music seemed interesting.</li>
                    <li><strong>SOCY 1511 Local Social Science - Sociological Approaches to Local Issues:</strong> It was a required course to take here at UNCC and was one of the only ones available that I felt interested in.</li>

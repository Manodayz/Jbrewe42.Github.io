            <h2>What is Dungeons and Dragons?</h2>
            <p>Dungeons and Dragons (DnD) is a fantasy role-playing game where players create characters and embark on adventures guided by a Dungeon Master, which is what I do in my party.</p>
            <p>Our campaign takes place in the Eberron world, a unique magepunk setting full of magic, political intrigue, and chaos.</p>
            <p>If you don't know what Magepunk is, I'd suggest watching "Arcane". Very good show and a great example of a magepunk world (past episode 3).</p>
